# Music-Recommedation-with-Spark-and-ALS
Music recommendations with Alternating Least Squares using Apache Spark

For this project, a recommender system that will recommend new musical artists to a user based on their listening history. Suggesting different songs or musical artists to a user is important to many music streaming services, such as Pandora and Spotify. In addition, this type of recommender system could also be used as a means of suggesting TV shows or movies to a user (e.g., Netflix).

To create this system I used Spark and the collaborative filtering technique.
